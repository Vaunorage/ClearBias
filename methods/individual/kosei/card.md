### **Title**
An efficient discrimination discovery method for fairness testing.

### **Metric**
The method relies on **individual discrimination**.

*   **Definition:** Individual discrimination is defined as occurring when a machine learning model gives different results to two similar individuals who only differ in their protected attributes (e.g., gender, race).
*   **Formalization (from Definition 1):** A data item `I` is considered discriminatory if there exists a counterpart `I'` that differs from `I` only in a set of protected attributes `Q`, and the difference in the model's output `|f(I) - f(I')|` is greater than a pre-determined threshold `Î³`.

### **Location**
The method finds discrimination in **machine learning models (classifiers)**. It is a black-box testing approach, meaning it does not need access to the model's internal structure but queries it with different inputs to observe its behavior.

### **What they find**
The method aims to find and report **individual discriminatory data items**. These are specific input data instances (test cases) that trigger unfair behavior from the model, as defined by the individual discrimination metric. It does not find discriminated groups but rather individual instances of discrimination.

### **What does the method return in terms of data structure?**
The method returns a **set of discriminatory data items**. As described in Algorithms 1 and 3, the output is a collection (like a list or set, denoted as `D` or `D_local`) of data items that have been evaluated and confirmed to be discriminatory.

### **Performance**
The performance of KOSEI was evaluated by comparing it against a landmark technique, AEQUITAS, on which it is based. The evaluation used three datasets, three types of classifiers, and was measured on detection ability and efficiency.

*   **Discrimination Detection:** KOSEI significantly outperformed AEQUITAS, detecting **5,084.8% more discriminatory instances** on average across all experimental configurations.
*   **Execution Time:** KOSEI was much more efficient, running on average in just **7.5% of the execution time** of AEQUITAS (or 13.3 times faster).
*   **Test Case Quality:**
    *   **Precision:** KOSEI's generated test cases were **3.04 times more likely** to be discriminatory (higher precision) than those generated by AEQUITAS.
    *   **Duplication:** KOSEI is designed to avoid evaluating duplicated test cases, whereas the evaluation showed that in AEQUITAS, **98.8% of evaluated data were duplicates**, leading to inefficiency.
